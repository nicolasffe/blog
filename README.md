# Simple Blog â€” React + Prisma

A modern, minimal blog application built with **React** (frontend) and **Express + Prisma** (backend).  
Posts, comments and likes are persisted using **Prisma** with **SQLite** for a lightweight local development DB.

This repository is ideal for learning full-stack development with Prisma and for quickly prototyping blog features.
